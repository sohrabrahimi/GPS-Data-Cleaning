# GPS-Data-Cleaning
This project is intended to show the reuqired steps in order to clean the location data collected from a typical GPS devide. Often time stdy subjects who carry a GPS devide may shut down the device, or walk in areas that are not within the study area. In this project I will clean and aggregate the GPS data points collected from 142 GPS divices during 30 days at Catoctin Mountain Park. This project is part of a larger project which aims to study where the hikers are most likely to stop and next, investigate what are the reasons for them to stop. This research has been designed by a group of landscape designers who would like to see the extent to which sceneries affect ones choice of path and walking speed. Our location data includes latitude, longitude and altitude. In here, I have used python to delete data points that are not within the study area and distinguish and delete data points that have been collected while in a vehicle. 

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
